The line like this is the specification of the master gms file (the top-level
gms file). This indicates this "include-sample.gms" file is the subroutine file
of "gams-sample.gms".

This master file information is used for `gams-show-identifier' and
`gams-show-identifier-list' commands. For example, type F7 on parameter `a'
below. GAMS mode recongnizes that the top-level file is "gams-sample.gms" and
shows the declaration part of `a' in "gams-sample.gms" file.
